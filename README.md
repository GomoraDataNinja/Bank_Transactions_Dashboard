# Bank_Transactions_Dashboard

## Description 
I have developed a comprehensive Power Bi  dashboard , with detailed visualizations and insights on the bank transactions performance by location.

## Background
The dataset provided include the following columns

•	Customer demographics: Customer age, Occupation, Location

•	Transaction details: login attempts, transaction attempts , transaction type , channel 

The dataset serves to provide information on customer demographics, and transaction details to gain more insights and provide informative visualization for the bank to make data driven strategies.

## Objectives
In this project, I will perform data cleaning using excel and do the visualizations using powerBI. Also, to bring out the insights on the performance by each segment and the most groups doing the transactions , the challenges they are facing and some recommendations.

## Data Cleaning(Excel)
1.	The dataset had no duplicates and blanks making it more accurate for analysis.
   
2.	I have changed the column name “Location” to “City”
   
3.	I have added the “Sec” to “Transaction Duration” column for easy interpretation .

## KPI’s Requirements
1.	Transaction amount
   
2.	Account balance
	
3.	Login attempts
	
4.	Location
